# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas-Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas in Python involves using Pandas library to understand, clean, and visualize a dataset, in order to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it helps us understand the data, identify patterns, relationships, and potential problems. In this project, we will use the Pandas library in Python to perform EDA on a dataset.

The dataset can be of any type, such as CSV, Excel, or JSON. We will start by importing the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and then perform the following steps:

Understand the data: We will examine the data structure, column names, data types, missing values, and unique values to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

Clean the data: We will clean the dataset by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and removing duplicates.

Explore relationships: We will explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset using various methods such as correlation, scatterplots, and heatmaps.

Visualize the data: We will create visualizations to help us understand the data better. We can create histograms, box plots, line charts, scatter plots, and other types of charts.

Draw conclusions: Based on our findings from the EDA, we will draw conclusions and insights about the data, which will help us in making decisions and predictions.

The goal of this project is to gain experience in using Pandas library for EDA and to develop an understanding of how to perform EDA on any dataset.
